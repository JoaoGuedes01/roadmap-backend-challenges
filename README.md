# Roadmap Backend Challenges

This repository contains solutions to backend projects from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) as part of the Backend Developer Roadmap. Each folder in this repository holds the implementation for a specific challenge tackled from the roadmap.

## Structure
- Each project is organized in its own directory, with source code, documentation, and related files.
- The main README provides an overview, while each project folder contains its own detailed README and instructions.

## Projects

- [Task Tracker CLI](task-tracker-01/readme.md): A Python command-line application for managing tasks (add, list, update, delete, mark status). No external libraries required.

More projects will be added as progress continues through the roadmap.

## How to Use
1. Browse the folders for individual project solutions.
2. Refer to each project's README for setup and usage instructions.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/roadmap-backend-challenges.git
